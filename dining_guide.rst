Around Town (Possible Dinner and Evening)
-----------------------------------------

If you want to venture away from the University of Washington 
you have a few options. Capitol Hill and Downtown Seattle can 
be accessed via the light rail and are south of UW. To the west 
of UW there are a few neigborhoods that can be reach via buses,
Wallingford, Fremont, and Ballard. These locations might be hard 
to get there and back for lunch but could be a good place to get 
dinner and/or drinks in the evening.

Capitol Hill and Downtown Seattle can be reached by the light 
rail which can be caught at the University of Washington Station 
on Montlake Blvd. This is a 0.6 mile / 1 km walk from Kane Hall. 
There are also buses (48/197/271/542) along 15th Ave which connect 
to the light rail station, this includes <0.3 miles / 0.5 km of walking. 

<Bus directions to neighborhoods>

The transit timetables are integrated into the popular map apps, such as Google Maps.
There is also the One Bus Away app for buses which gives you live updates
as to when the next bus is due at each bus stop.

Seattle is served by taxis as well as rideshare services such as Lyft and Uber.
There are also car-share services such as Car2Go and ReachNow, but
street parking is limited in Capitol Hill and Downtown. Check out `SDOT <http://web6.seattle.gov/sdot/seattleparkingmap/>`_ for streat parking or popular map apps, such as Google Maps, to find garages.

**Capitol Hill**

*15-20 minutes via public transit*

Historically the LGBTQ centre of Seattle, Capitol Hill has grown to be one of the most
popular nightlife areas in the city. There are many food options here as well and bars

*20-25 minutes via public transit*
 
The University Station is the next stop on the light rail. It is the closest station to 
the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) and situated in the business district of Seattle. There are 
many fast eats that serve the downtown workforce. As well there are bars and evening 
restaurant nearby that often have happy hours. The vibe is often more upscale and serving

International District has a lot of great food. If you are looking for dim sum this is where 
you want to be. There are lots of great authentic cuisine here along with bubble tea, and
karaoke. 

**Fremont**

*25-30 minutes via public transit*

Fremont is known for its quirky, artistic flair. It’s home to the Fremont Troll sculpture, the most-frequently opened drawbridge in the United States (which doubles as an art studio for the current artist-in-residence) and a number of dining spots and bars. The easiest way to get to Fremont from the U-District is to grab either the 31 or 32 bus. Fremont, like the UW, also lies on part of the Burke-Gilman Trail.

+Fremont is something of a nexus of tech companies.  Google, Tableau, Getty Images, Olis Robotics, and Adobe (among others) are there.

I am especially fond of `Schilling Cider <https://www.schillingcider.com/home>`_ which has one of the finest selection of hard ciders in the area [Full disclosure: my daughter works there].  Must be over 21.  Dog friendly.

*30-35 minutes via public transit*

Ballard is the Scandinavian cultural center of the city and has recently been the focus of a lot of new development. The easiest way to get to Ballard from the U-District is to grab the 44 bus.

There are a lot of shops and nightlife in the historic center and the formerly industrial-centric area is exploding with breweries. Ballard alone has 11 breweries, a cidery, a distillery and a winery and the adjacent neighborhoods have even more!
