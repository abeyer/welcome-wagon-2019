Public Transport
----------------

The University of Washington is situated about 5 miles North of downtown
Seattle.

**Light Rail**

Seattle is served by the `Link Light Rail <https://www.soundtransit.org/schedules>`_.
The nearest station to Kane Hall is the University of Washington
Station at the northern end of the line. NB: Don't get confused with
the similarly named University Street Station, which is downtown!

Our venue is about a 10 minute walk from the Light Rail station, over a
pedestrian bridge and slightly uphill through campus.

There are trains running every 10 minutes, and the line starts south of
SeaTac airport. It takes about 70 minutes to get from the airport to the venue.

Tickets can be bought at the station (either one-way, or returns) at
automated kiosks. You can also purchase Orca Cards, which let you tap-on and
tap-off to pay as you go.

**Buses**

There are regular bus services run by King County Metro to the University
district. There is a stop on campus, and many other buses stop on Campus
Parkway which is a 5 minute walk away.

The timetables are integrated into the popular map apps, such as Google Maps.
There is also the One Bus Away app for buses which gives you live updates
as to when the next bus is due at each bus stop.


Ride Shares & Taxis
-------------------

Seattle is served by taxis as well as rideshare services such as Lyft and Uber. There are also car-share services such as Car2Go and ReachNow, but there may not be much public street parking near the University.


Driving
-------

The University is accessible from the I-5, at the 45th St exit. Follow `directions to central campus <https://transportation.uw.edu/getting-here/drive?ref=#directions-to-central-campus>`_. The conference is in Kane Hall on Red Square. There is parking both on campus and on the street near the campus. Parking on campus is the best option Saturday. Both locations are free on Sunday.

The closest on campus lot is the `Central Plaza Garage <https://transportation.uw.edu/park/events>`_ underneath Red Square and it the best option. It is $10 for Saturday `if arriving before noon <https://transportation.uw.edu/park/visitor>`_ and free on Sunday. Other campus lots are $5 on Saturday. When entering campus stop at a gatehouse to purchase a pass and get directions to a lot (ask for something near Kane Hall).

Kane Hall lies on the western edge of the university's campus. It is a short walk from University Way, Brooklyn Ave, 12th Ave NE where some street parking is available. Hourly rates range from $1 to $2.50 and may be limited in duration check `sdot to discover all pricing <http://web6.seattle.gov/sdot/seattleparkingmap/?xmin=2271624.40&ymin=439790.48&xmax=1282224.40&ymax=546098.81&basemap=street>`_. On Sunday, street parking is also free. There is a pedestrian overpass from Campus Parkway (south of 41st St) to campus that leads right into Red Square. Kane Hall will be on the forward left as you enter the square.

Sights
------

**Downtown Seattle - Pioneer Square**

*25-30 minutes via public transit*

To get to Pioneer Square take the light rail to Pioneer Square Station. Pioneer Square is going through a revival 
and there are many galleries, cute shops and food options.

**Fremont**

*25-30 minutes via public transit*

Fremont is known for its quirky, artistic flair. Itâ€™s home to the Fremont Troll sculpture, the most-frequently opened drawbridge in the United States (which doubles as an art studio for the current artist-in-residence) and a number of dining spots and bars. The easiest way to get to Fremont from the U-District is to grab either the 31 or 32 bus. Fremont, like the UW, also lies on part of the Burke-Gilman Trail.

+Fremont is something of a nexus of tech companies.  Google, Tableau, Getty Images, Olis Robotics, and Adobe (among others) are there.

**Ballard**

*30-35 minutes via public transit*

Ballard is the Scandinavian cultural center of the city and has recently been the focus of a lot of new development. The easiest way to get to Ballard from the U-District is to grab the 44 bus.

There are a lot of shops and nightlife in the historic center and the formerly industrial-centric area is exploding with breweries. Ballard alone has 11 breweries, a cidery, a distillery and a winery and the adjacent neighborhoods have even more!

**Queen Anne**

*40-45 minutes via public transit*

Queen Anne lies between the Fremont/ Ballard neighborhoods and downtown; unfortunately because it lies directly across the lake from the University District, there is no direct public transportation option. The simplest way to reach Queen Anne is by taking the Light Link downtown to the Westlake station and then transfer to any of the numerous northern-bound busses, depending on your final destination (routes 2, 3, 4, 13, 29, D).

Lower Queen Anne is the area closest to downtown and is the location of many of Seattle's performing arts and the world-recognizable Seattle Center.
